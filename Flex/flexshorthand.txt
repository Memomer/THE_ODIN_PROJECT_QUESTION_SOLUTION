CSS shorthand property which saves time and energy of the developer by reducing the size of words used to convey a meaning,
  Like defining padding in all four sides and  typing padding-top, padding-bottom and so forth we can just type padding: X Y Z A;
   here, reduction of property name whilst increase the use case is the speciality of CSS shorthand.



Flex shrink and flex grow when used inside a flex item specifies the relative
  growth-rate/shrink-rate one item will have in terms of the other when the browsers size is changed
    as it directly affects the containers size.


If one doesnt want an "ITEM" to grow or shrink then one need to specify flex-shrink/grow=0 in that item

flex basis sets the basis/start point size of flex items, flex shorthand basis defaults to 0% and flex-basis defaults to auto which means basis will equal
to width set in the property


if basis is auto width is the size of the content unless if the width is provided manually
