# THE_ODIN_PROJECT_QUESTION_SOLUTION

#This repository contains solutions and my notes for each subtopic taught in the odin project.

#I am coming with a way to make the process of revision as easy as possible by adding my ideas and thoughts in comments when i experiment with code.


#The initial files will be imperfect as I am pushing it out as i am figuring stuff out.


#I plan to make one page notes with as much visual elements and as less words possible, to keep a record.
